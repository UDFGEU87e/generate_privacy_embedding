This is a TensorFlow implementation of the Generating Privacy Graph Embedding.



## Requirements
*TensorFlow 1.8.0
*python 3.5
*scikit-learn
*scipy
*numpy

## Run the demo

```
python privacy_emb.py -dataset rochester -model APGE
```

## Data
In order to use your own data, you have to provide

an N by N adjacency matrix (N is the number of nodes), such as ./data/yale_adj.pkl
an N by D feature matrix (D is the number of features per node), such as ./data/yale_feats.pkl
an N by M attribute matrix (M is the number of attibutes per node), such as ./data/yale_label.npy
Here, the i-th row of feature matrix is the concatenation of i-th userâ€™s every attribute one-hot vector. And the element in the i-th row and j-th column of attribute matrix is the label of i-th user's j-th attribute.

In yale_feats.pkl, elements in columns 0 - 4 correspond to the utility attribute student/faculty status, and elements in the bottom 6 columns correspond to class year, which is privacy here. In rochester.pkl, elements in the bottom 19 columns correspond to the utility attribute class year, and elements in the 6,7 columns correspond to gender, which is privacy here.

In yale_label.npy, elements in the first cloumn correspond to student/faculty status, and elements in the last column correspond to class year. In rochester_label.npy, elements in the last cloumn correspond to student/faculty status, and elements in the seconed column correspond to gender.
